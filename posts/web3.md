## Introduction

Web3 was coined in 2014 by Gavin Wood, president and founder of the Web3 Foundation. However, to fully understand its context, we need to go back to the beginning.

## From Web1 to Web2

**Web1**: The original web was a simple, static, information-based environment. It focused on sharing documents using the HTML protocol over the internet. Users were mostly passive consumers of information.

**Web2**: After significant innovation, the collaborative and dynamic Web2 emerged. It introduced user-generated content, social media, e-commerce, and cloud services. However, these platforms are centralised business models where user data is a commodity.

## Enter Web3

With the advent of blockchain technology, we have seen the rise of **Web3**. Web3 is based on a permissionless, decentralised network of nodes running cryptographically secured blockchains. Key characteristics include:

- **Token Economies:** Platforms can create and manage their own tokens.
- **Decentralised Applications (Dapps):** These run autonomously via smart contracts.
- **Codified Governance:** Transparent and immutable rules are enforced by code.
- **User Data Control:** Users retain control of their personal data, rather than relying on centralised platforms.

In short, Web3 removes the need for trust in intermediaries, offering no single point of failure and a publicly auditable, immutable ledger.

## What Makes Web3 Different From a Blockchain?

Although Web3 is built on blockchain technology, the two are not identical. Many industries already use blockchains (both private and public) for:

- **Immutable Audit Trails:** Ensuring provenance of products and components.
- **Secure Data Layers:** Enhancing data security for drone airspace management and IoT devices.

However, these blockchains often do not disrupt the existing centralised, data-centric business models. Web3, on the other hand, typically involves public blockchains that underpin new, decentralised models such as Dapps, self-enforced governance, self-sovereign identities, and token economies.

## Key Concepts in Web3

### Cryptocurrencies and Tokens

The most well-known use case of blockchains is **cryptocurrencies**, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum’s Ether (ETH). These native tokens transact value and pay transaction fees on their respective blockchains.

**Smart contract-based platforms** can also create custom tokens without the need for a separate blockchain. Token standards like **ERC20** (for fungible tokens) and **ERC721** (for non-fungible tokens, NFTs) enable universal compatibility with wallets, exchanges, and other Dapps.

Carefully designed token economies and governance rules increase the credibility of a project and encourage sustainable business models.

### Smart Contracts

**Smart contracts** introduced programmable logic into blockchains. While Bitcoin’s blockchain is essentially a ledger for transactions, Ethereum added the concept of addresses that can hold and execute code. When deployed, these contracts are:

- **Decentralised and Immutable:** Cannot be altered once deployed.
- **Transparent:** Their code is publicly viewable.
- **Trustless:** No intermediaries or external enforcement needed.

As “the code is law,” smart contracts remove third-party fees and resolve trust issues, opening the door to new types of decentralised business models.

### Dapps (Decentralised Applications)

**Dapps** are full applications built on smart contracts. They:

- Run autonomously and trustlessly.
- Have no central point of failure or attack.
- Require no personal data and are permissionless.

Dapps are driving innovation in various sectors:

- **Decentralised Finance (DeFi):** Decentralised exchanges, lending, and staking.
- **Gaming:** Play-to-earn mechanics, lotteries, and VR-based economies.
- **Social and Content:** Content-driven economies and fan tokens.
- **NFT Markets:** Property, art, collectables, and fractional ownership.

### DAOs (Decentralised Autonomous Organisations)

**DAOs** encode governance rules and token-based voting mechanisms as smart contracts. They resemble traditional companies with shareholders, but instead of central management, rules are enforced by code. This creates a more collaborative governance structure:

- **Votes** determine future directions.
- **Proposals** are executed automatically on-chain.
- **No hierarchy**, only algorithmic enforcement of rules.

Major projects like Uniswap, MakerDAO, and Aave are DAOs, demonstrating the viability of decentralised governance.

### DIDs (Decentralised Identifiers)

**DIDs** allow secure, self-sovereign, persistent, portable, and verifiable digital identities. Unlike traditional Web2 authentication methods (e.g., email or phone numbers), DIDs are tied to cryptographic keys stored on a public blockchain.

This approach:

- **Eliminates centralised data silos** and surveillance capitalism.
- **Prevents data breaches at a central point of failure.**
- **Gives users full control over their identity and data.**

Owners manage their own private keys and provide claims directly to verifiers, ensuring authenticity and reducing dependency on large centralised identity providers.

## Beyond the Basics

Web3’s rapid innovation has enabled new applications and business models. We see convergence with other technologies such as VR (virtual reality), AR (augmented reality), AI (artificial intelligence), and IoT (internet of things):

- **Metaverses:** Immersive, socially connected 3D worlds integrating tokenised assets and economies.
- **Cross-Industry Adoption:** DeFi, gaming, NFT marketplaces, DAOs, and DIDs are permeating various sectors.

As the technology evolves, understanding the top-level concepts helps cut through the noise. Web3’s decentralised and user-centric paradigm continues to influence the future direction of the internet.

## Conclusion

The shift from Web1’s static documents to Web2’s centralised platforms and now to Web3’s decentralised, trustless, and tokenised ecosystem represents a major evolution in how we use the internet. Although it is fast-moving and complex, the fundamental principles and technologies driving Web3 will likely shape the future of online interaction and commerce.
